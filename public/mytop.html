<h1>THE UNORTHODOX CRITIC</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies:</h2>

<hr />

<h2>The Godfather(I & II)</h2>
<p>The part I(1972) & II(1974) of The Godfather trilogy feature one of the finest works by a filmmaker, the magnum opus of Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel with the same title(written by Mario Puzzo, published in 1969). The entire cinematic essence and class of these films, in my opinion, cannot be recreated. Starring one of my favorite actors, Al Pacino, part I revolves around the inner business conflicts between the five families of North America, majorly among the Corleones and the Tattaglias. Michael(played by Al Pacino) undergoes a transformation from being completely uninterested in the business to taking over the entire business empire and succeeding his father. The cinematic brilliance can be sensed with the intensity of the execution of the screenplay. Each scene is an artwork in itself. The grounded and realistic violence keeps one thrilled all along. It's subtle yet effective filmmaking is my favorite form of cinema.
    The part II shows a spinoff of Michael's father, sir Vito Corleone as well as the further establishments in the present time after Micael took over. The film runs back and forth in time, showing the rise of Vito Corleone from a worker in the bakery to a Business Don(the past) and the ongoing tensions among the Corleones and their contemporaries, Michael has new rivals, the rivals ready to assassinate him and his family, the rivals he pretends to befriend all throughout but kills in the final act. The shock value and shifts in these films will need all your attention. With the taste of an average moviegoer, I'm not sure that you'll be entertained by it, but you'll respect it...^_^</p>

<h2>The Shawshank Redemption(1994)</h2>
<p>Written and directed by Frank Darabont, this cinematic jewel depicts the dynamics of lives of the prisoners in the Shawshank prison as well as in general. It shows the story of a bank manager, Andy Dufresne(played by Tim Robbins), who's falsely accused and arrested for murdering of his wife and her lover, while both were making love. Sent to the Shawshank prison he found friends in Ellis Red(played by Morgan Freeman) and company and enemies in "The Sisters" who frequently rape him. He befriended the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, by saving him from inheritance tax and sheltering the money legally. The kind of cruel warden Samuel Norton, controls the entire prison and makes life hell for the prisoners. He gives The Bible to every prisoner to give them divinity. Andy is also fond of rocks, so he asked Red(the man who could get things) to get a rock hammer and a poster of his favorite actress Rita Hayworth. Andy becomes a man of importance as he did financial records for the Warden and gave financial assistance to others. Later on, a young man arrives to the prison was taught English by Andy and reveals a thing that would change his life which it didn't. All this sounds weird but what if I tell you all that all these objects and subplots helped him escape the prison and live freely and completely legally safe without being proven innocent for the charge of murders? And there are many more of them? Sounds more weird, right? But that's why the movie is all here...;)</p>

<h2>Pulp Fiction(1994)</h2>
<p>The title means fiction put up in a rough and raw manner. A filmmaker who earned my respect early on in his career, Quentin Tarantino, crafted this comic crime thriller in such fashion that you feel you just saw many films in the length of one. Revolving around the lives of multiple subjects: A Hitman and his psychological friend, a boxer and his wife, a bald fat Niger and his beautiful mrs., and a robber couple, all connected to each other, with the Niger being the boss of the former 2, the film leaves the essence of 4 stories in one plot, with scenes ranging from the subtle dating of the Hitman's friend with the Niger's wife on his own orders, to the powerful Niger getting pounded in the ass by a policeman and a shopowner. There's too much in this film to watch and barely a scene to miss, Tarantino deserves a bow...++.</p>

<h2>The Dark Knight(2008)</h2>
<p>Featuring one of my favorite actor-filmmaker duo, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan, this film has no reason to not watch. Based on the Batman comics from the DC universe, the complex and thrilling filmography of this film keeps you on teh edge of your seat all through. The Batman has to finish the crimes of the Joker(played by Heath Ledger) to protect the Gotham city and he does it all in style and I feel I need to say no more. You might have already watched, but do if you haven't...:)</p>

<h2>The Fight Club(1999)</h2>
<p>The film revolves around the unnamed narrator(played by Edward Norton) and his friend Tyler Durden(played by Brad Pitt). The narrator is suffering from insomnia which leads him to discover counselling clubs for all sorts of diseases, which would let him sleep at nights. Things were smooth until he finds himself annoyed a drug addict, named Secilia, repeating his thing because of which he couldn't sleep again. He get things sorted with her and both take separate days to the clubs. On his flight to his hometown, he finds a desirable and cool friend in Tyler Durden, who lets the narrator stay at his residence after his flat bursts out. One day Tyler asked him to hit him hard and this idea was satisfying to both of them, with this and the idea of the clubs, they began the "shhh...remember the first rule of shhh...". Secilia doesn't get ruled out quick and returns as Tyler's lust interest. The "shhh..." becomes a flu among the depressed men and they out on a mission of taking down all big tax buildings under Tyler Durden's orders, the narrator is annoyed that Tyler ain't informing him nothing and he wants to stop all of this, but how will he stop himself? Watch it out to know...;)</p>


<h2>The Unorthodox pick:</h2>

<h2>Rockstar(2011)</h2>
<p>Being an Indian, I feel it's my duty to bring Indian cinema jewels like Rockstar to the global fame and notice. The film was initially neglected by the audience since Indians do not have a taste good enough to apppreciate great cinema and stuck on the typical shit of mediocre actors like Shah Rukh Khan. I won't say it's a flawless film but it's beauty and magic lies in it's imperfections. Written and directed by the ace filmmaker Imtiaz Ali(my favorite and the finest of modern age Indian cinema), the film runs in complex linearity, going back and forth in back and forth. The plot revolves around Janardhan Jakhar, short for JJ(played by Ranbir Kapoor), a Delhi college boy from Pitampura who aspires to be a Jim Morrison kinda sensational musician from an early age. The opening scene shows him arrested and beaten up by the cops. He escapes and takes the bus to his concert, prepares up, spills water on his face, starts and boom...we're taken to his past when he was trying in auditions but couldn't make it and sometimes became a topic of laughter due to his uncool and boring presence. Khatana bhai, his friend who runs the college canteen, tells him that all great artists have a thing in common and that is pain, that music comes out from a broken heart. Setting out on a mission of heartbreak, JJ finds such possibility in Heer(played by Nargis Fakhri),his college's most desirable girl. He fakes loving her, straight away proposes her and gets the refusal that he wanted. Now a heartbroken JJ goes back to Khatana bhai, who straight away calls him out for the drama since he won't be fighting for chutney for samosas if he was really heartbroken. JJ, annoyed by this is totally confused on how would he bring pain to him. He starts harsassing Heer so that she could get him arrested and he gets the pain but that doesn't happen. One, an annoyed Heer asked him wtf he really needs, to which he couldn't reply and walked away. He always turned his face on seeing Heer, which however bothered her. One day, Heer tells him that she has forgiven him and there's no need of shyness. JJ thanks her and confesses that he never loved her and never found her hot and cool and that she's very clean girl and not his type. Heer feels insecure on this and reveals her other side. She told him that she has booked tickets for tonight's show of an 18+ film, Junglee Jawaani(literally, Wild Youth) and invited him for the same. He was surprised and went with her. They hasd a fun banter and became bestfriends. They prepare a list and begin fulfilling Heer's wild wishes before she gets married to a Europian NRI. Heer began feeling safe and homely around him. She also invited him to Kashmir for her wedding rituals. JJ rejected Platinum Music's call from the college and went up straight to Kashmir. Heer introduced him to her friends as Jordan, suggesting it as a short and cool name. slowly fell in love with him and wanted him to hug her tightly. She married and went to Prague. Now, JJ goes back to Pitampura where he is scolded by his brothers, forced to give up on music, hr began to work in his family's transport business. Then begins the journey of JJ from Janardhan Jakhar to Rockstar Jordan, all sorts of painful things arrive in his life and this leads to the rise of Jordan with the inner turmoil of him losing Heer. He was involved in constant arguments with Dhingra, the owner of Platinum music(played by Piyush Mishra) and never obeyed him, he couldn't let Jordan go since he was bringing in huge profits for the label. Since Jordan slowly became completely lost and unaware of the good or the bad, he constantly lands himself in trouble which Dhingra milks as negative publicity. Jordan had become what he aspired for but he wasn't happy and was always burning from inside(shown marvellously by Ranbir through his eyes) because of separation from Heer. A reporter who's given the task of gathering all info about him for the articles meets Khatana bhai and Jordan and tells him that Dhingra is sending his artists to Prague, Jordan couldn't stop himself and signed all agreements and meets Heer again who is now mentally ill. Both begin the same list thing and fell deeply in love and Heer cheated on her husband of which he was unaware. She felt guilty all along but couldn't help the magical attraction she had towards Jordan and vice versa. Heer became an assistant in the management company organising Jordan's concerts in Prague. The two could thus spend more time together and became obsessed with each other. Heer was so annoyed about cheating that she finally argued with Jordan called him selfish and asked him to leave her and go to hell, to which she later cried hiding away from him. Jordan's time in Prague was over, but he went all the way from the airport back to Heer to bid a final goodbye. Home security alarm system caught him and she couldn't resist pleading the cops to leave him. Her husband has now become aware of everything. Heer fainted out of her illness and the rauma of separtion. She is taken back to Kashmir where her mom calls back Jordan to her life. Heer's condition miraculously improved because of him, and the two went together to his concert after being discovered by his manager Khatana bhai. Heer is not safe among the media so he sent her back to her home but her condition became worse and she went into a coma, her family was shocked to hear that Heer is pregnant and her sister blamed Jordan for her condition. Jordan visits Heer but she's damaged to an extent that his magic couldn't wake her up. He was completely destroyed from within and told Khatana that "Mujhe ye sab kuchh nahi chaahiye, mujhe nahi banna bada. Mera dil nahi tootna chaahiye Khatana bhai."("I don't want any of this, I don't want to be big. My 'heart should not break' Khatna bhai"). Things started from JJ searching for a heartbreak and ended upon Jordan wishing his heart should not break. We are taken back to the present as Jordan sings to call Heer back and then we have a visual of Heer coming out from the crowds and the film ends unexplained. Special appreciation for Ranbir, who produced one of the all time greatest performances of world cinema and the musical trio of AR Rahman(mysic composer), Mohit Chauhan(the voice of Jordan) and Irshad Kamil(lyricist) who literally produced India's finest musical album of all time. I know it's been too long but I could still not cover the entire beauty of this film. Watch it to feel it...<3</p>
